# Assignment 2
## Exploring the Trends in COVID-19 Cases and COVID-19 related Death in 2020

#### Data Selection
For this assignment, the dataset used was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa?select=us_states_covid19_daily.csv "Dataset").
This dataset had a usability score of 9.7. 
The data described the number of COVID-19 cases and related deaths across the United States by state and counties in 2020.


#### Goals
The aim of this interactive application is to analyze trends in COVID-19 cases and related deaths across the United States. 
Understanding the regional trends can provide better insight into the patterns of changes in COVID-19 cases. 
Moreover, a regional analysis can help develop a stronger understanding of the patterns and make future predictions. For instance, if the number of COVID-19 cases increased in **state A** from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2020 and the number of COVID-19 cases increases in **state B** only for a few months and then plateaues, this gives us an insight into how well the state has the situation under control. 
Moreover, identifying states that are better handling the COVID-19 situation and have been able to successfully reduce or prevent increases in the number of COVID-19 cases can encourage other states to adopt policies that have helped improve public health.

In order to allow users to identify trends in changes of COVID-19 cases and related deaths, this applications enable to analyze both cases and related deaths. In each case, users can view the changes in average monthly cases/deaths across all states through an animated map. This animation highlights regions with dramatic changes. To further observe those changes in detail for a particular state, users can click on the state. 
This generates a follow-up graph for that state allowing users to visualize the trends in the absolute number of COVID-19 cases/deaths. Users can also view the realtive changes in the number of COVID-19 cases/deaths by observing the relative plot.

#### Rationale Behind Decisions
The first aim was to allow user to analyze both COVID-19 cases and related deaths. Since both of them can be seperately visualized, I added the option to switch between the two using a dropdown menu. This reduced the clutter on the page.

The next aim was to visualize the trends in the changes across all the states in the US. Maps usually help visualize geographic information. Consequently, I colored the states in the map depending on the number of COVID-19 cases/deaths. However, the time componenet still 

A clear description of the goals of your project. Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals. 
A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
